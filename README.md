## 💬 About The Project
Omnifood project is a summary of my knowledge of HTML&CSS and web design.
This is my first major project since I started learning programming.

The project used HTML and CSS with CSS Grid and Flexbox.
Thanks to the use of media-queries, Omnifood is a fully responsive website that works on mobile devices, laptops and desktop computers.
An interesting functionality in the project is the hamburger menu on mobile devices and active links in the navigation to help you better browse the website.
The entire page is carefully designed with proper margins, padding, spacing and typography.
Omnifood use well-established website components and layout patterns professional-looking designs.
